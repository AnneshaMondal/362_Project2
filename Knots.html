    <p><strong> Most commonly square-knot work is used in belts and lanwayds.
      The products can be incredibly fancy or plain depending on taste, but all made with care.
      I make regular 12-line belts of cotton siene and nylon, 16-line belts and larger 20-line belts. For pricing and more sizing information please contact me here.
      The belt buckles are silver or gold colored brass buckles, but custom buckles can be provided as well. These are working, durable belts which are handcrafted for daily use, to ensure you are ordering the correct belt size please refer to the sizing chart.

Due to the color of the product use they can get dirty easily, but throwing the product in a sock in the washer and dryer will clean it right up!
