    <p><strong> Most commonly square-knot work is used in belts and lanwayds.
      The products can be incredibly fancy or plain depending on taste, but all made with care.
      I make regular 12-line belts of cotton siene and nylon, 16-line belts and larger 20-line belts. For pricing and more sizing information please contact me here.
      The belt buckles are silver or gold colored brass buckles, but custom buckles can be provided as well. These are working, durable belts which are handcrafted for daily use, to ensure you are ordering the correct belt size please refer to the sizing chart.

  <p><strong> The tradition of coxcombing your helm is an old one, orginally developed to protect the wood from salt and sun on wooden wheels, it is continued on today. Not only does it help with slippery wheels, but can also serve as a decorative feature to enhance the appearance of the cockpit. The wheel size I typically use us 15" destroyer style wheel, but custom sizes can be recommended. I do not work with 32 or 40 inch wheels as they are too pricey!
    I am available to travel to your location to meet you at your wheel. For product pricing and information please contact me here.
